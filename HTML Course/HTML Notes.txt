 * WHAT IS AN INTERNET? 
  -> It is a network of multiple devices, basically it is the interconnection of devices.
     The devices(mobile, laptop, desktop, smart watches, smart tvs, smart fridges). 
	 These all are connected through some medium. It may be connected through cable, 
	 fibre optics, ethernet cable etc.
  -> we transfer the data or files or information after connecting the devices. we follow
     few rules while transfering the data, rules are the protocols, some common protocols
	 are TCPIP, smtp, ftp, http protocols etc.
  -> our websites are based on http protocol as you can see in the url of every website.
     Eg: google.com, youtube.com etc.
  -> when we search for any keyword in the google, so the request goes to the google
     server , it may be in America or somewhere, we get some response. 
	 NOTE: the request we are sending is called the HTTP request.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________
 * HOW WEBSITES ACTUALLY WORKS? 
  -> Lets take an example of w3schools and hit enter, when enter hit, our browser sends
     HTTP request to its server, here the w3schools server, then the server sends
	 response in the form of some files.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * DEV TOOLS & NETWORK TAB: 
    i) Elements Tab: it is basically our html and css tab.
   ii) Network Tab: We can see all the calls happening, like the JS, CSS, HTML files
	    We can basically review the Request urls in this tab.
		-> The network tab listens to the network activity. When we reload the page or
		   perform a request, whatever the browser sends the requests to the server will 
		   be recorded in the network tab. And the server sends some response.
		-> Now the first request which we see is the Initiator request send by the browser
		   through url whose type is a document, which means its a HTML document. So the
		   w3schools server gave the response of type: document.
		   - we can preview the response that how it looks in html and see the url and the 
		     response as well in the Network tab.
		   - Similarly we have multiple responses such as fonts,icons, images, css, js file 
		     requests etc. Make sure that whenever the browser understands the link, it sends 
			 the request immediately.
		   - We also have filters to check the css, js, doc, media, img, font requests separately.
		   NOTE: whenever we see the type as document, then it will definitely be html.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * LETS MAKE OUR OWN SERVER LOCALLY - (CREATING A DUMMY SERVER)
    -> First we have installed the vs code text editor, bcoz it is easy and gives automatic boiler
       plate etc.
    -> Basically we have created a folder in vs code and added some files such as txt, mp4, img
       etc. Because we are creating a local server through which we can access these files, by 
       sending a request.
    -> Once after adding the files, click on Go live, so the live server is created now, and you 
       may able to see the files, and can check the url, the browser created a server with
       http://127.0.0.1:5500/. The servers main url is the folder which we created on workspace.
    -> By adding the slash we can type the image.png then enter	to access that particular file.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * STARTING WITH BASIC HTML:
    - HTML: describes the structure of the page.
  	- Added heading and description in the html file, also created a txt file with intro. So, the 
	  browser creates a local server through which we can access/serve the txt & html files.
	- Now we are able to see the response of the server, but while sending the request, we are 
	  unable to see the request and its files, so when we learn backend development, we will create
	  our own server, wherein, we will be able to see the request coming as well.
	- We are unable to see the request coming and going as of now, as we are client(browser).
	- We can only see the request url, in which url request has gone & the response which we got.
	  But what request we have got, we cannot see that.
	 
	i) Element & Tag: <h1>, <p> is a tag, this tag creates an element.
	ii) <img> -> self closing tag.
	-> title tag changes to 'Hello HTML'
	-> <img src="./image.png" alt="Image"> | Here src is attribute & value is ./image.png
	-> we can also add more attributes such as width, height in img tag.
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * FAVICON ICONS:
	-> When we hard reload the page, we get the favicon.ico in network tab, which is coming as 404
	   as we have not added any icon in our folder.
	-> Basically, the favicon.ico is the icon which is in the tab of the html. To get the favicon
	   icon, we can simply type download favicon icon -> Unzip -> and move it to the folder.
	-> when we again reload the page, the icon gets displayed.
	-> We can also draw the favicon icon by going to draw favicon -> Download -> Add in folder.
	-> We can also paste the html link which is created in the draw favicon and can give any name.
	-> Just type "how to add favicon in html" , you will get w3schools link where you can just
	   copy and paste the link in the head section.
	   Eg: <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico">
	   - But this href name icon should be already present in the root folder of your project.

 * Shortcut to select a sentence or long text: 
     Shift + Alt + right arrow
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ALL ABOUT IMAGES:
   - Img Height & width attributes:
	-> the image automatically adjusts the height. And the aspect ratio will be maintained.
	-> NOTE: whenever we give height to the image, the aspect ratio of the image gets destroyed.
	-> Aspect Ratio means image kitne by kitne ka thaa woh change hojata.
	-> You can go to google and check "img attributes in html".
	
   -> When we try to check the responsiveness of the image, the image is getting overflow. So we
      use: style="width: 100%;" in HTML element tag. So this code will take care of the overflow
	  issue while checking responsiveness while reducing the width of the screen. If we are
	  increasing the width of the screen the image will take full screen width still.
   -> And if we add the style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" , on adding max-width, the image 
      will not exceed the 600px even if we increase the width more as well. 
	  
  <!-- This overflows the image in mobile -->
  <!-- <img src="image.png" alt="Scenary image">    -->

  <!-- This will not overflow but it takes full screen width of any sizes -->
  <!-- <img src="image.png" alt="Scenary image" style="width: 100%;"> -->

  <!-- This will not exceed the max width and we can see the white space if the screen width 
        is more than 600px -->
  <!-- <img src="image.png" alt="Scenary image" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;"> -->

 * HOSTING THE FIRST WEBSITE ON NETLIFY BY DRAGGING THE PROJECT FOLDER:
 
  -> Till now we were displaying the website on our local server which we created, so only we can
     see that website, if you want everyone to see your website, we will deploy it in the internet,
	 so that everyone can see & access the website.
