 * WHAT IS CSS? 
  -> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It is used to give styling, such as colors etc and make
     the wepage more attractive.
	 
	* Three ways to write CSS:
	  i) Inline CSS    Eg: <p style="color: "green";">Hello World!</p>
	 ii) Internal CSS  
	      Eg: <style>
		        p{
				  color: red;
				 }
		      </style>
			- Here p is called the element selector.
	iii) External CSS
	    - link a style file externally

 * Understand how HTML loads CSS:
   -> First of all the browser is displaying the content through HTTP request.
   -> The server got created and server sends the index.html to the browser.
   -> Go to network tab, reload the page. So there we display:
       i) index.html -> Other as initiator because the brwser is sending it.
      ii) style.css -> index.html:12 as initiator bcoz while checking html file, it got this link.
