 * WHAT IS CSS? 
  -> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It is used to give styling, such as colors etc and make
     the wepage more attractive.
	 
	* Three ways to write CSS:
	  i) Inline CSS    Eg: <p style="color: "green";">Hello World!</p>
	 ii) Internal CSS  
	      Eg: <style>
		        p{
				  color: red;
				 }
		      </style>
			- Here p is called the element selector.
	iii) External CSS
	    - link a style file externally
	
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Understand how HTML loads CSS:
   -> First of all the browser is displaying the content through HTTP request.
   -> The server got created and server sends the index.html to the browser.
   -> Go to network tab, reload the page. So there we display:
       i) index.html -> Other as initiator because the brwser is sending it.
      ii) style.css -> index.html:12 as initiator bcoz while checking html file, it got this link.

 * Basic CSS Properties related to text:
    p {
	  color: coral;
	  font-size: 32px;
	  font-weight: 700;
	  /* text-decoration: underline; */
	  /* text-decoration: overline; */
	  /* text-decoration: line-through; */
	  /* text-decoration: underline wavy; */
	  text-decoration: none;
	  font-family: sans-serif;
	  text-align: center;
	  font-style: italic;
	}

 * INTRODUCTION TO SELECTORS:
 
    i) Element selector
	   Eg: li {
	        color: red;
			}
			
   ii) Class selector
       Eg: .classname {
	        color: red;
			}
			
  iii) id selector
       Eg: #idname {
	        color: red;
			}
			
   iv) Attribute selector
       Eg: [adnan] {
	        color: red;
			}
	   Eg: [adnan="procodrr"] {
	        color: blue;
			}
			
    v) Combinator selector
	   Eg: ul li {
	        color: red;
			}
	
	NOTE: colorPick EyeDropper extension, it is a chrome extension, which gives you the exact
	      color of the screen image by hovering it.

 * CASCADE, SPECIFICITY & INHERITANCE:
    i) Cascade: When we write the styles in the css, the importance increases from top to bottom.
			li {
			  background-color: green;
			  color: aquamarine;
			}
			li {
			  background-color: orange;
			}
			li {
			  background-color: cornflowerblue;
			  color: brown;
			}
		- This displays the cornflowerblue color because of cascade will give importance to the
		  last lines of code by overriding the top lines.
		  
	Q) What is Specificity?
	A) element >> class >> id
	NOTE: Eventhough, when we call the element by class, at the top line, now comes the specificity
	      You can check the specificity in the vscode by hovering the element style.
		  The element with more specificity gets more importance.
		  
	NOTE: This also works with multiple style files, if we have two as style.css & style2.css,
	      then if the link of style2 is down in the html, it works with cascade but if the 
		  specificity is high in style.css, it displays the style file changes.
		  
    Q) What is Inheritance?
	A) if we give color to the body tag, then all the childrens color will get changed, because 
	   it is getting inherited.
